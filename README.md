Build a simple REST service with a few endpoints
1. One to take in a string, and returns a SHA256. We should persist the message and the SHA256 in a database.
2. One endpoint to take SHA256, and to return a message (if the SHA256 exists in the database)
3. One to delete a message from the database
4. One to list all the stored messages
Feel free to use any libraries you need, but be ready to explain your reasoning. Tests are encouraged.
